Also, just for fun, Fireflies is now my new favourite song completely accidentally. Looking it up to listen for it on Spotify from now on. 

This project is created based on Udemy's JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio, ZTM Academy. It's my way of building up my JavaScript skills. 
The way I work on these projects are like this. I get the general information in the introduction, and the gist of how the project should look . Then I go and create my version of it stylistically just because I like to challenge myself and stand out. When I am done with HTML/SCSS I move on to JavaScript and think through the process of how I would implement it. I give myself a fair go before I run into some places where I need extra help. Then I jump through the material to the point where I feel I can understand what was done, and then go and implement it myself. Depending on my knowledge I might need to do it a couple of times, otherwise, I am most happy when I make it work with the least help from the tutorial.

I hope you can enjoy this code as much as I did when implementing it.
